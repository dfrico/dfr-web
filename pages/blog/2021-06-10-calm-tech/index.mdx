Some time ago in my [old website](https://old.dfr.codes) I published [an entry](https://old.dfr.codes/calm_tech.html) on calm technology. That post was just a summary of my notes/highlights on [calm technology](https://calmtech.com), an entry on my personal wiki. These are my own words on the topic.

I was reading today this article called [iOS 15, Humane](https://potential.app/ios-15-humane), which mentions Steve Jobs' famous sentence ["A computer is a bicycle of the mind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmuP8gsgWb8). I don't want to focus this article on iOS or any OS in particular, or add beautiful mockups on how the interface could be to help the user be more intentional with their use of technology, but I would like to write about **intention and use in this context**.

I you also are a person who has thought about **technology and minimalism**, needs, uses, and habits, I'm sure you may be somewhere in a balance where, on one side there's absolute-yet-practical minimalism (dumb phone ‚Äîmaybe a computer too‚Äî and that's it), and on the other side there's a bunch of gadgets and gimmicks that promise to make your life easier at the cost of **maintenance, money, and mental space**.

I'm talking of course about the dark side of calm technology, the temptation to buy a smart speaker to interact with our _domotized_ environment in a more active way, a smartwatch to be informed in a more subtle/simplified way, smart lights and appliances, etc. You can throw [gear adquisition syndrome](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gear_acquisition_syndrome) there and you have an explosive consumerism loop of constant adquisition and renewal.

Hope you enjoyed this article, see you on the next one <span role="img" aria-label=":v:">‚úåüèª</span>
