You might be familiar with [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), but maybe you don't know that you can [implement your own hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) to build reusable logic on top of hooks.

## What is a (custom) React hook?

React hooks are still somewhat new, from February 2019. In web development years that's like a decade, though, and probably another 278 libraries have been launched since then. They allow you to write functional components (instead of classes) and still use state and [other lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).

As I mentioned before, you can write a custom hook in your application if you want a modular piece of logic that uses hooks as well.

## How can we use them?

In this particular case, I wanted a deep comparison hook. Funnily enough, I based my code on [this fragment](https://github.com/sandiiarov/use-deep-compare/blob/master/src/useDeepCompareMemoize.ts) I found, by user sandiiarov in GitHub. I cleaned the code a bit, and it ended up being identical to [this other piece of code](https://gist.github.com/kentcdodds/fb8540a05c43faf636dd68647747b074#gistcomment-2830503) I found by Kent C. Dodds.

The code is the following:

```javascript
// existing hooks we want to use here
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
// deep comparison utility by lodash
import isEqual from 'lodash.isequal';

// we're using memoization on an array of dependencies
// (like useEffect does), to perform a deep comparison
// and update them if their values changed.
export function useDeepCompareMemoize(dependencies) {
  const ref = useRef();

  if (!isEqual(dependencies, ref.current)) {
    ref.current = dependencies;
  }

  return ref.current;
}

// we export the hook as a reinterpretation of useEffect
// but evaluating the dependencies using our custom hook.
export default function useDeepCompareEffect(callback, dependencies) {
  useEffect(callback, useDeepCompareMemoize(dependencies));
}

```

## How can we test a custom hook?

The tricky part about testing a custom hook, like in other cases, is that we need to emulate the behavior of a react hook, without rendering the application (as we run the tests from the CLI).

Luckily, [React testing library](https://testing-library.com) has a great set of [testing utilities for React hooks](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library). One of their use cases is precisely if _"You're writing a library with one or more custom hooks that are not directly tied to a component"_, which fits our utility function.

We can use it to implement a test that mocks a callback function that will be called everytime the dependencies array changes:

```javascript
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';

it('should trigger callback only on dependencies change', () => {
  // we're creating a fake callback function to check wether or not
  // it's been called.
  const callback = jest.fn();
  // we create a fake array of dependencies.
  let dependencies = [{ a: 1 }];
  // we'll use RTL's renderHook to return a result and a rerender method
  const { result, rerender } = renderHook(() =>
    useDeepCompareEffect(callback, dependencies)
  );

  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  // dependencies didn't change
  rerender({ callback, dependencies });

  dependencies = [{ a: 2 }];
  // dependencies did change, triggering useEffect
  rerender({ callback, dependencies });

  // we check here that we called our custom fake callback twice so far
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
});
```

Here is [the code for the utility](https://github.com/Vizzuality/usa-resilience-opportunity-map/blob/testing/utils/deepCompare.js), and this is [the tests file](https://github.com/Vizzuality/usa-resilience-opportunity-map/blob/testing/utils/deepCompare.test.js).
