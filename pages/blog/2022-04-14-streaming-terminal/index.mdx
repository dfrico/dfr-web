If you follow programming YouTubers, chances are that you might have seen a video from [Takuya Matsuyama](https://www.craftz.dog) ([devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/devaslife) on YouTube).

On a lot of his videos ([like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxhf50FIPI)) he records himself coding in the terminal, with a twist: the background of the terminal is not a plain color or his desktop, but the video feed from his camera.

If you try to replicate this using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), it's pretty easy to create a scene with two sources: the camera feed and the display capture with the terminal. However, the 'display capture' source completely blocks the camera feed.

      The display source blocks the camera, even if you set a transparent background for the terminal.

I'm pretty sure there's a way to eliminate the terminal background by **applying a chroma key filter to the terminal's background color**, but that can mess with your terminal color settings/theme and I'm not sure if you can add a blur effect to the transparency. I might try this in the future but, for now, this is the easiest way I could find.

What you are going to do in order to achieve a similar effect is:

1. Right click your camera source and click on "Windowed proyector (source)". You have now a nice background window to put your terminal on top of it.
2. (Optional) Turn off your camera preview in OBS (üëÅ icon), you don't need this and it might have an impact on what to render before streaming/recording.
3. Adjust your display capture source to capture an area of the screen where the projector window AND the terminal can fit nicely on top of each other.
4. Tweak your terminal settings (I'm using [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)).
I created a new profile for this called 'Streaming', with bigger font size, 83% transparency (settings/profiles/window), and 40% blur radius. Doing this makes your terminal almost transparent and uses your camera feed as a background.
5. Adjust your colorscheme to fit your new background nicely, create a nice contrast. I'm using [Adventure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Adventure.itermcolors) here to make it quicker, but it's probably better to customize the colors yourself.

This is the result ([video preview](https://twitter.com/blayhem/status/1514268137067368451)):

      The terminal transparent background doesn't block the camera view, and the blur causes a nice effect to the captured background.

You can now record or stream your terminal for tutorials and whatnot, bonus points if you use a nice camera to capture the background.
